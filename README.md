The Virtual Pet Shelter was a different project from Virtual Pet but it started the same. I started testing for my VirtualPet class. I tested that I could find all the attributes of a given pet, but when it came to th euser interactions that's where it changed.

I had to come up with a method for feeding all of the pets which is where the Map came in. I had to test for adding and removing pets from the Map. I then tested for finding all the pets attributes, feeding and watering all the pets. I also had to test for playing with an individual pet instead of playing with all the pets. I also included a tick method like I did before to affect the attributes of the pets.

When it came to the user interface it was pretty straight forward and similar to the virtual pet. The only thing I had to add was the ability to adopt and admit pets which 
did give me problems. After hours of trouble shooting I realzed the always important "input.nextLine();" was missing from the end of the user options.
